# LEAD SCORING CASE STUDY
Problem Statement :
An education company named X sells online courses to industry professionals on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a Lead.
Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. To make the lead selection process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads - ‘Hot Leads’.
